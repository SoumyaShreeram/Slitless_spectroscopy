# Study of the Galactic Centre Region of the Milky Way Using Slitless Spectroscopy

This project was done as part of my specialization semester at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland. The work done as part of this project was conducted at MPIA, Heidelberg, Germany.

Current gaps in out knowledge of the Galactic Center (GC) region motivates the proposal of mid-res observations R=4000 of over a million GC stars in the near-infrared Ks-band between 2.1-2.4 micrometers using slitless spectroscopy. The aim is distinguish between early and late types stars. The data used for modelling was obtained from the Galacticnucleus survey. Since standard approaches fail in crowded field of views like those found in the GC, the Nearest Neighbour Approach (NNA) was formulated for observing in the slitless mode. The spectral types of the target stars in ~60-75% regions, with 5-12 neighbouring stars, could be accurately recovered using slitless spectroscopy. These results indicate that observations in the slitless mode are feasible with some further improvements.
